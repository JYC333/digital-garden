# Digital Garden: My Second Brain

**_Currently, the content is written only in Chinese. I'm still considering whether or not to add an English translation._**

Welcome to my Digital Garden - a space that's 99.999% synchronized with my "Second Brain" aiming to capture 99.999% of what I learn, think, feel, and realize in the form of atomic notes.

## What is the "Second Brain"?

The concept of the "Second Brain" is my realization of the knowledge network philosophy with the help of the dual-link note software, Obsidian. Through atomic notes and evergreen notes, I record and build connections between pieces of knowledge. I first encountered the idea of the "Second Brain" in 2017 through Xiaoneng Xiong, viewing the computer as an extension of our own brains to aid in information collection, processing, organization, and internalization. As time progresses, I'm refining my understanding and application of this concept to assist personal growth. Here, you'll find the overarching framework and historical development of my "Second Brain." Feel free to explore.

## Origins of the "Digital Garden"

The concept of the "Digital Garden" became widely recognized during a digital learning research network conference held at Stanford University in 2015. Mike Caufield's keynote, [The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/), shed light on this idea. Mike believed that the stream mode (timeline-dominated) couldn't bear systematic knowledge. In the Web 2.0 era, the content production mode of personal blogs and social media is fundamentally stream-centric. If everyone drowns in this stream, the internet will soon become a chaotic place filled with fragmented knowledge, making it hard to contribute to humanity's collective understanding.

Distinct from traditional blogs, the "Digital Garden" publishes content based on logical connections, interlinking them as if wandering through a garden. Moreover, the content isn't a perfectly articulated article at the onset; it evolves and enriches over time, much like seeds scattered in a garden that take root, sprout, and grow robustly across the seasons.
